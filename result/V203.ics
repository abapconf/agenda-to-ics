DESCRIPTION:In this session\, we will share the challenges and lessons we l
	earned when we built the partner solution FEXS API Connect for the S/4HANA
	 public cloud with Clean Core ABAP. We will first explain the possible int
	egration options for integrating as a partner with the S/4HANA public clou
	d and why we chose to build it on an embedded ABAP cloud environment. We w
	ill discuss the challenges we face with using an S/4HANA public cloud envi
	ronment and how we overcome the restrictions of cloud ABAP and the RAP mod
	el. We will talk more about using RAP events\, bgPF\, XCO libraries\, and 
	other capabilities of the ABAP cloud\, which will help us realize our solu
	tion.
