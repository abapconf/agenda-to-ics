DESCRIPTION:Key User Extensibility is a major pillar of the SAP S/4HANA Ext
	ensibility concept. It enables business experts to do last mile extensions
	 by their own. But it also provides a lot of value for developers.\n\nDeve
	loper Extensibility on the other hand empowers the developer to develop ex
	tensions in a clean core compliant way using the ABAP Cloud development mo
	del.\n\nIn this session\, we provide an overview on these extensibility op
	tions and will provide best practices when to use what. We provide example
	s for extensions that are realized as combination of key user and develope
	r extensibility.
