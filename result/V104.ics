DESCRIPTION:A session on unit testing business objects in RAP covers the fu
	ndamental principles and practices of testing business logic within the RA
	P framework. Participants will learn how to design and implement unit test
	s for RAP business objects using the ABAP Test Double Framework. The sessi
	on will focus on creating test scenarios to validate business rules\, data
	 consistency\, and transactional behaviors without relying on a database c
	onnection or external dependencies. Key topics include setting up the test
	 environment\, creating mock objects\, simulating data retrieval and modif
	ication\, and executing tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of 
	business logic in a RAP application. This hands-on session aims to equip d
	evelopers with the skills to confidently test and maintain high-quality RA
	P applications.\n\nBased on the GitHub Repo from Christian Drumm (https://
	github.com/ceedee666/modern-abap-curriculum) the participants can follow t
	he session as a hands-on exercise
